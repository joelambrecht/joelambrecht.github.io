In this project for Computer Algorithms, I designed and implemented a Two Way Directed Graph Builder that solved the following algorithm problem:

You are biking to work along city blocks and would like to find a route that is completely up hill, and then completely down hill. In other words, once biking downhill you should not have to bike uphill again. Given a graph where each node represents an intersection and every path represents a street that is either uphill or downhill, detect whether you can bike to work by first only going uphill, then only going downhill.

This project prepared me for my capstone experience by encouraging me to think through design implementations before beginning coding. The creative approach in this solution- to work from both sides to find if a route exists- required a good deal of foresight and consideration before ever touching a keyboard. This process was reflected in my work designing the Entity-Relationship Diagram for the capstone. I spent the first few weeks solely focused on thinking through how all the attributes needed to interact, and only once I had drawn the whole schema out on a chalkboard, mentally tested it against a wide variety of situations, and ensured it come robustly handle every input did I begin programming. This preparation allowed our team to go the whole semester with only minimal changes to the database.
