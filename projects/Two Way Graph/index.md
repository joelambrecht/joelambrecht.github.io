In this project for Computer Algorithms, I designed and implemented a Two Way Directed Graph Builder that solved the following algorithm problem:

You are biking to work along city blocks and would like to find a route that is completely up hill, and then completely down hill. In other words, once biking downhill you should not have to bike uphill again. Given a graph where each node represents an intersection and every path represents a street that is either uphill or downhill, detect whether you can bike to work by first only going uphill, then only going downhill.

You can view the raw java code for my solution using the view link above, or download the java file to run your own example through it.
