## Two Way Directed Graph Builder

In this project for Computer Algorithms, I designed and implemented a Two Way Directed Graph Builder that solved the following algorithm problem:

You are biking to work along city blocks and would like to find a route that is completely up hill, and then completely down hill. In other words, once biking downhill you should not have to bike uphill again. Given a graph where each node represents an intersection and every path represents a street that is either uphill or downhill, detect whether you can bike to work by first only going uphill, then only going downhill.
