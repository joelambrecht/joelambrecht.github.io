Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Joe Lambrecht; I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas. I'm about to graduate with a  double major in Computer Science and Data Analytics, and this site is a reflection of my work over the past 4 years toward that goal. I invite you to explore the links at the top of each page to see a video introduction, check out some projects I've worked on at St. Thomas, and learn a bit more about who I am. If you'd like to get in touch, my contact information is available on my resume.
