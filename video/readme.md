Hi! Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. My name is Joe Lambrecht, and I'm currently a senior at the University of St. Thomas. I'm graduating this May with degrees in Computer Science and Data Analytics, and minors in Economics and Statistics. Beyond my academic commitments, I'm also the president of the Economics and Data Science clubs on campus, and I'm very active in the Rock Climbing Club.

I began programming in 6th grade through a website design project, and knew immediately that programming was going to be more than just a hobby. In high school, I took an introductory statistics course and found my passion for data analysis. At the university of St. Thomas, I had the opportunity to merge my love of programming with data analysis through my dual major, and found internship opportunities at Preventice and Verizon that helped me to learn and grow in my field. This summer, I will begin a full-time postion on the Data Science team at Boston Scientific, where I can apply what I have learned over the past 4 years to cutting-edge research on cardiac monitoring using machine learning models.

I hope you enjoy looking around my portfolio, and I'm eager to get to know you better too! My phone number, linkedin information, and email are all included on my resume. If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out through any of these channels, and I will be more than happy to continue a conversation about anything that sparks your interest.
